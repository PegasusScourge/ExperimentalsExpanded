Description['peb2302'] = "Ballistic unit delivery system developed in secrecy by the UEF. With a lack of a direct-fire land experimental, Percivals have seen a high demand in battles all across space. In an effort to quell complaints the Percy (as it is lovingly called) was quote 'Slower than a red-striped glacier', the Noah Unit Cannon was developed to speed it's deployment to the front line. As an added bonus, it can deploy many other units as well."
Description['psl0202'] = "Following the creation of the legandary Ythotha Assault Bot, most Seraphim commanders were satisfied with their battlefield arsenel. However, upon encountering the sheer number of experimentals the other factions could field comparitevely, the Ilshavoh Mk.II was pressed into service, building upon the amazing T2 chassis and adding a mighty, short range teleport device. The device has a teleportation range about 2.5 times the range of the main cannon, but takes a considerable time and energy cost."
